# ThePhenomenon1

4 years 6 months ago, July 2021, I didn't know Python. Over 15 300 hours of computer programming - 1 617 days later - I am a Python/JavaScript Full-Stack Developer.

I have deployed my React/DRF Django Application, on the powerful Railway cloud platform. 
This is an ecommerce Boutique built with RAG, Langchain, Google Cloud, Tailwind, Tanstack Query and PostgreSql. Powered by AWS and A.I. Infrastructure, it features:-

<br>
* A.I. ASSISTANT and INSTANT REALTIME MESSAGING BOARD (Retrieval Augmented Generation, Langchain, Websockets, Channels).

<br>
* EMAIL AUTHENTICATION (Google OAUTH email social login, Django Allauth and JWT).

<br>
* WEB ANALYTICS (Business lead generation reports).

<br>
* PAYMENT API (Paypal, Visa, Major credit cards).

<br>
* SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO data modeling).

<br>
* SHOPPING CART and CHECKOUT functionality.

<br>
* CLIENT DASHBOARDS and ADMIN DASHBOARD (Customer Service Management and SKUs).
