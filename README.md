2 years ago, July 2021, I didn't know Python, just had a smattering of HTML.
Over 6 300 hours of computer programming - 720 days later - I am an advanced Python Programmer.

I have deployed my multi-tier Django Application, on the powerful cloud platform Railway.App. 
This is a real-World Boutique built with a Postgres database and Redis Enterprise. It features SHOPPING CART and EMAIL AUTHENTICATION functionality.
It boasts third-Party PAYMENT API integration (Paypal, Visa, Major credit cards). Powered by Amazon Web Services.
