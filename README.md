# ThePhenomenon1

16 months ago, 15th July 2021, I didn't know Python, just had a smattering of HTML.
Over 4 000 hours of computer programming - 467 days later - I am an Advanced Python coder. 

I have deployed my multi-tier Django Application, on the powerful cloud platform Railway.App. 
My Application is an Ecommerce / Superhero / Django REST Framework API. The API is powered by the PostgreSQL database.
It has been test-driven by the Fast API client Insomnia.

This backend web application's link is:-

https://pizza-delivery-superhero-api-production.up.railway.app

My tech stack includes:-

Django REST_Framework,
Sklearn,
Conda,
Selenium,
Insomnia,
Algolia,
Git.

I have also acquired Intermediate Machine Learning Certificate on the Kaggle platform under Alexis Cook. I begin my OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) journey.
