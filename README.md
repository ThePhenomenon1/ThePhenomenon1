22 months ago, 15th July 2021, I didn't know Python, just had a smattering of HTML.
Over 5 400 hours of computer programming - 636 days later - I am an advanced Python Programmer.

I have deployed my multi-tier Django Application, on the powerful cloud platform Railway.App. 
This is a real-World Boutique built with a PostgreSQL database. It features SHOPPING CART and EMAIL AUTHENTICATION functionality.
It boasts third-Party PAYMENT API integration (Paypal, Visa, Major credit cards). Powered by Amazon Web Services.

My 2nd Application is an Ecommerce / Superhero / Django REST Framework API. 
This Ecommerce API is powered by AWS and a Postgres database. It has been test-driven by the Fast API client Insomnia.
