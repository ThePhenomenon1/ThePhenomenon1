# ThePhenomenon1

4 years and one month ago, July 2021, I didn't know Python. Over 14 000 hours of computer programming - 1 491 days later - I am a Python/JavaScript Full-Stack Developer.

I have deployed my React/DRF Django Application, on the powerful Railway cloud platform. 
This is an ecommerce Boutique built with Langchain, Google Cloud, Tailwind, Tanstack Query and PostgreSql. Powered by AWS and A.I. Chatbots, it features:-

<br>
* A.I. ASSISTANT and INSTANT REALTIME MESSAGING BOARD (Langchain, Websockets, Channels).

<br>
* EMAIL AUTHENTICATION (Django Allauth) and JWT.

<br>
* WEB ANALYTICS (Business lead generation reports).

<br>
* PAYMENT API (Paypal, Visa, Major credit cards).

<br>
* SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO data modeling).

<br>
* SHOPPING CART and CHECKOUT functionality.

<br>
* CLIENT DASHBOARDS and ADMIN DASHBOARD (Customer Service Management and SKUs).
