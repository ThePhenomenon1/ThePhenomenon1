# ThePhenomenon1

12 months ago, 10th July 2021, I didn't know Python, just had a smattering of HTML.

Over 3 000 hours of computer program training - 332 days later - I am an Advanced Python coder.
Mentored by my brother @TheGiwi, a 3D graphics designer who is himself studying C++, I have in mostly chronological order done:-

(1) Brad Traversy's YouTube:-  "Python Course for Beginners"

(2) Moshfegh Hamedani's epic 6-hour YouTube:- "Python Course for Beginners"

(3) Allen Downey's book:- "How To Think Like a Computer Scientist 2"

(4) Allen Downey & 3 others' book:- "How To Think Like a Computer Scientist 3"

(5) Kylie Ying's YouTube:- "12 Beginner Python Projects" 

(6) Moshfegh Hamedani's:- "Django Tutorial for Beginners" 

(7) Moshfegh Hamedani's:- "Git Tutorial for Beginners"

(8) Al Sweirgat's 600-page magnum opus:- "Automate The Boring Stuff 2"

(9) Patrick Loeber's monster 6-hour YouTube tutorial:- "Advanced Python."

(10) Michal Jaworski and Tarek Ziade's 600-page magnum opus:- "Expert Python Programming 4."

I have acquired Intermediate Machine Learning Certificate on the Kaggle platform under Alexis Cook.

As I gain invaluable programming workplace experience, I begin my OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) journey.

I am also deploying my Django Application, on Heroku. It will be fire!
