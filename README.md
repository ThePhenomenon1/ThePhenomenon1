# ThePhenomenon1

4 years ago, July 2021, I didn't know Python. Over 13 600 hours of computer programming - 1 460 days later - I am a Python/JavaScript Full-Stack Developer.

I have deployed my React/DRF Django Application, on the powerful Railway cloud platform. 
This is an ecommerce Boutique built with GCP, Tailwind CSS, Tanstack Query and a Postgres database. Powered by AWS. It features:-

<br>
* EMAIL AUTHENTICATION (Django Allauth) and JWT.

<br>
* WEB ANALYTICS (Business lead generation reports).

<br>
* PAYMENT API (Paypal, Visa, Major credit cards).

<br>
* SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO data modeling).

<br>
* SHOPPING CART and CHECKOUT functionality.

<br>
* CLIENT DASHBOARDS and ADMIN DASHBOARD (Customer Service Management and SKUs).

<br>
* BLOG functionality and REALTIME CHAT integration.

<br>
* AUTORESPONDER integration (Mailchimp, AI).
