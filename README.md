# ThePhenomenon1

2 years and 2 months ago, July 2021, I didn't know Python, just had a smattering of HTML.
Over 6 800 hours of computer programming - 767 days later - I am an advanced Python Programmer.

I have deployed my multi-tier Django Application, on the powerful Railway cloud platform. 
This is a real-World Boutique built with a Postgres database and Redis Enterprise. Powered by Amazon Web Services. It features:-

<br>
Third-Party PAYMENT API integration (Paypal, Visa, Major credit cards - Cyber secure SQL data wrangling!).

<br>
REALTIME CHAT integration.

<br>
SHOPPING CART and CHECKOUT functionality.

<br>
EMAIL AUTHENTICATION functionality.

<br>
CLIENT DASHBOARDS - realtime SQL visualization.
