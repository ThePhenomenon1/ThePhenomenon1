# ThePhenomenon1

14 months ago, 15th July 2021, I didn't know Python, just had a smattering of HTML.

Over 3 600 hours of computer program training - 418 days later - I am an Advanced Python coder.
Mentored by my brother @TheGiwi, a 3D graphics designer who is himself studying C++, I have in mostly chronological order done:-

(1) Moshfegh Hamedani's epic 6-hour YouTube:- "Python Course for Beginners"

(2) Allen Downey's book:- "How To Think Like a Computer Scientist 2"

(3) Allen Downey & 3 others' book:- "How To Think Like a Computer Scientist 3"

(4) Moshfegh Hamedani's:- "Django Tutorial for Beginners" 

(5) Moshfegh Hamedani's:- "Git Tutorial for Beginners"

(6) Al Sweirgat's 600-page magnum opus:- "Automate The Boring Stuff 2"

(7) Patrick Loeber's monster 6-hour YouTube tutorial:- "Advanced Python."

(8) Michal Jaworski and Tarek Ziade's 600-page magnum opus:- "Expert Python Programming 4."

(9) Max Goodridge's 62-video exploration of the Django Framework.

(10) Justin Mitchell's 7-hour blockbuster on building Django REST APIs.

I have acquired Intermediate Machine Learning Certificate on the Kaggle platform under Alexis Cook.

As I gain invaluable programming workplace experience, I begin my OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) journey.

I am also deploying my multi-tier Django Application, on Heroku. It will be fire!
