21 months ago, 15th July 2021, I didn't know Python, just had a smattering of HTML.
Over 5 200 hours of computer programming - 613 days later - I am an Advanced Python programmer.

I have deployed my multi-tier Django Application, on the powerful cloud platform Railway.App. 
This is a real-World fashionable Boutique built with a PostgreSQL database. It features EMAIL AUTHENTICATION and SHOPPING CART functionality.
Third-Party PAYMENT API integration being coded in realtime! Powered by Amazon Web Services.

This Ecommerce API is powered by AWS and a Postgres database. It has been test-driven by the Fast API client Insomnia.
