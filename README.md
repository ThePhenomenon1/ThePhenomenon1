18 months ago, 15th July 2021, I didn't know Python, just had a smattering of HTML.
Over 4 500 hours of computer programming - 540 days later - I am an Advanced Python programmer. 

I have deployed my multi-tier Django Application, on the powerful cloud platform Railway.App. 
My Application is an Ecommerce / Superhero / Django REST Framework API.

This Ecommerce API is powered by AWS and the PostgreSQL database.
It has been test-driven by the Fast API client Insomnia.

This backend web application's link is:-
